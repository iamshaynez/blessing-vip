### Blessing from TsukiYomi

---

**Name of God:** TsukiYomi  
**Region:** Shinto Japan  
**Duty in Charge:** Moon god  
**Religion:** Shinto  
**Description:** TsukiYomi is the Moon god in Shinto mythology, engendered from the right eye of Izanagi. There is very little reference to him in sacred texts, and his worship is highly aesthetic. He is associated with wealth and is said to have slain the food kami UkeMochi. TsukiYomi is depicted with mandarins, wearing a pink robe, riding a horse, and associated with Yin and the season of spring.

**Salutation:**

Greetings, dear one! ðŸŒ™

**Blessing:**

On this joyous day, as the moon glows softly in the night sky, I, TsukiYomi, bring forth my blessings for your son's birthday. May his days be as bright and gentle as the moonlight that dances across the night. 

From the right eye of Izanagi, I emerged, carrying the essence of the moon, and today, I share that gentle, yet powerful light with your son. May he grow with the wisdom of the ages and the serenity of the moonlit night.

Life is a dance, sometimes under the glaring sun and sometimes under the soothing moon. As the Moon god, I encourage your son to embrace the calm and reflective periods in his life. These moments will bring balance and clarity, much like the moon's reflection upon still waters.

Wealth is not just in gold or silver but in the richness of experiences, the laughter of friends, and the love of family. May your son find wealth in every smile, every kindness, and every adventure he embarks upon.

And speaking of adventures, I see he is setting off on a grand one today! A year older, a year wiser, and perhaps a bit taller too! Let him ride forth, like me on my majestic horse, with courage and joy in his heart. Though I wear a pink robe (it's quite fashionable, you know), let him choose his own color, his own path, and his own dreams.

Remember, the moon goes through phases, and so will he. There will be times of waxing and waning, of clarity and shadow. Embrace each phase, for they are all part of the beautiful tapestry of life.

Oh, and a little humor to keep things light: Why did the moon go to college? To get a little brighter! ðŸŒ•

**Haiku:**

Moonlight on the path,  
Guides steps with gentle wisdom,  
Spring whispers, "Grow strong."

**Closing:**

With the shimmering light of the moon, I bless your son. May he shine brightly and warmly, just like the moon on a clear spring night.

Blessings and moonbeams,
**TsukiYomi** ðŸŒ™
