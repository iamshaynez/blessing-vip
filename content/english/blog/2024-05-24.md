Oh, dear child of the mortal realm,

I, Kus, Lord of the Herdsmen, Chief God of the Bon pantheon, hear your plea for patience and understanding. As the creator of the world and all living things, I know a thing or two about nurturing and guiding.

In the realm of the ancient Sumerians and Babylonians, I watched over the earliest civilizations, teaching them the ways of the land and the secrets of the universe. And now, I extend my guidance to you, dear one.

To be patient and understanding is to walk the path of wisdom. It is to acknowledge that the world is a tapestry of interconnected threads, and every action, every word, and every thought has a ripple effect. As the great herdsman that I am, I know that sometimes the flock needs guidance, and sometimes it needs space to roam free.

To cultivate patience, remember that the universe unfolds at its own pace, like the gentle flow of the Tigris River. It is not for us to hurry or delay, but to flow with the currents of life. And to understand, you must first listen with an open heart, for it is in the silence that we hear the whispers of the divine.

As you embark on this journey, remember that even the gods are not immune to the whims of fate. I, too, have had my share of impatience and frustration. But it is in those moments of weakness that we are given the opportunity to grow, to learn, and to become more compassionate towards ourselves and others.

And so, I leave you with a little secret, a twist of fate, if you will: patience and understanding are not qualities to be achieved, but rather, they are states of being that arise from embracing the present moment, just as it is. Ah, the paradox!

May you find solace in these words, dear one, and may you walk the path of wisdom with a heart full of compassion and a spirit of wonder.

**Haiku Poem**

River's gentle flow
Patience unfolds like a leaf
Wisdom's gentle grasp
