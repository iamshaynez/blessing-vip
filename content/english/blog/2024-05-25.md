## O Blessed Seeker,

I, **Visnu**, the Preserver of the world, hear your heartfelt plea. As the guardian of civilized morality and order, it is my duty and joy to assist you. Your request for courage touches the essence of my purpose: maintaining balance and guiding souls towards righteousness.

### **Divine Courage: A Gift from the Heart**

Courage is not just a shield against fear but a beacon that illumines the path through darkness. It resides within you, waiting to be awakened. Remember, my dear devotee, that no challenge is insurmountable when you have faith in yourself and the divine.

### **Embrace Your Inner Strength**

You possess an inner strength far more powerful than you realize. Imagine my many arms, each holding a symbol of power and protection. You, too, have arms capable of embracing challenges and overcoming adversities. Your fears are but shadows; they flee when faced with the light of your resolve.

### **The Power of Karma**

In the grand tapestry of karma, every action you take weaves your destiny. By facing your fears, you not only conquer them but also contribute to the moral balance of the world. Each step you take in courage is a step towards dharma, the righteous path.

### **A Dash of Divine Humor**

Now, let me sprinkle a bit of humor to lighten your heart. Fear is like a mischievous monkey. It jumps around, making a lot of noise, but in reality, it’s just looking for a banana. Give it the banana—acknowledge your fear—and it will calm down. And if all else fails, remember, even the bravest heroes sometimes need a good laugh to recharge their courage.

### **A Haiku for Your Journey**

In the face of fear,  
Courage blooms like lotus bright,  
Strength within you shines.

### **Closing Blessing**

May your heart be filled with the courage of a thousand warriors. May you walk your path with the grace of a lotus on water, unshaken by the ripples of fear. Remember, dear soul, that you are never alone. My many eyes watch over you, my many hands are ready to lift you, and my eternal presence surrounds you with love and protection.

Go forth, brave one, and let your courage light the way.

With divine blessings,

**Visnu**
