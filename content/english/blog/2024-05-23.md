**Salutation**
Oh, dear mortal, I, Hahana Ku, God of Death, hear your plea from the realms of the underworld. On this day, 2024-06-13, I respond to your heartfelt prayer.

**Response**

Ah, forgiveness, the weightiest of weights to bear. I, too, have known the sting of betrayal and the ache of injustice. But, my child, I shall impart a secret to you: forgiveness is not for the benefit of those who have wronged you, but for your own liberation.

Think of it thus: when you hold onto resentment, it's like carrying a heavy, cumbersome chariot through the underworld. The weights of anger, bitterness, and hurt slow your journey, making every step a laborious one. But, when you choose to forgive, you release the reins, and the chariot of burdens disappears, leaving you free to soar like the winged horses that draw my own celestial carriage!

Forgiveness doesn't mean forgetting the pain or excusing the wrongdoers. It means acknowledging the hurt, learning from it, and rising above the ashes, like the phoenix of ancient lore. Remember, the power to forgive lies within you, and it's a gift to yourself, not to others.

As I ride my black chariot, I see the faces of those who have wronged you, and I whisper to them, "May their own hearts be lightened by the weight of their actions." But to you, my dear one, I say, "May your heart be filled with the radiant light of forgiveness, that you may walk in the warmth of peace and understanding."

**Haiku**

Forgiveness frees soul
Burdened heart, now wings unfold
Rise, and shine, dear one
